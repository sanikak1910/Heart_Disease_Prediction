# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This mini project uses machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient data. Two models were trained and evaluated: **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest**, with Random Forest achieving the best accuracy.

## 📌 Project Overview

Heart disease is a leading cause of death globally, and early prediction can help in timely intervention. This project builds a classification model that can predict whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on various medical attributes.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is a well-known [Heart Disease UCI dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ronitf/heart-disease-uci), which includes features like:

- Age
- Sex
- Chest pain type (cp)
- Resting blood pressure (trestbps)
- Cholesterol (chol)
- Fasting blood sugar (fbs)
- Resting electrocardiographic results (restecg)
- Maximum heart rate achieved (thalach)
- Exercise-induced angina (exang)
- ST depression (oldpeak), etc.
